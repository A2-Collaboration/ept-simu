\title {The Mainz Endpoint-Tagger}

\section{Motivation}

The Glasow photon tagging spectrometer at Mainz has
an electron band width of 6 to 95 \% of the incoming electron
Energy, $E_0$ \cite{glatag}. After an upgrade \cite{taggup} to accomodate the
energies avaible with MAMI-C, roughly up to 1.6 GeV \cite{mamic}, this will
allow for tagged photon energies up to roughly 1.54 GeV. In order to
increase this photon energy, post bremsstrahlung electrons of energies
below roughly 100 MeV have to be detected, which is not possible with this
Main Tagger, MT. The goal can be achieved by installing a small tagger
upstrem of the MT, which then detects these lower energy eletrons. It is
reasonable to build this Endpoint Tagger, ET, such that there is an overlap
of the band widths of both taggers, ET and MT. Therefore, the ET should be
capable of detecting post bremsstrahlung electrons with energies up to
at least 150 MeV. When the ET is used, the MT
can only serve as a cleaning magnet. In order to guide the main beam safely to
the electron beam dump an additional Correcting Magnet, CM, is needed that
corrects for the deflection of the main beam by the ET.

Whit this installation in operation it is possible, for example,
to investigate the threshold region for the production of $\eta'$ mesons.

Since adding ET and CM to the tagger set-up will only be needed for special
experiments, this addition will be built such that it can take the space
which otherwise a goniometer box has, which helps to privide linearly
polarized photons from coherent bremsstrahlung. Thus, these two installations
can be interchanged.


\section{The ET-CM-MT set-up}

Figure \ref{etcmmt} shows the set-up of the magnets ET, CM and MT
in its location in the MAMI tagger-hall.\\

tagger, ET, and a correction magnet, CM. Only the main beam is indicated,
which ends in the beam dump, BD}

\end{figure}

The magnets ET and CM had once been used in the low-energy
Glasgow Tagger \cite{lowglatag} and there were named DS2 and DS4.
Modofications were needed in order to serve
the present purpose. In ET the Rogowski profiles were filled in with iron
and the pole gap was reduced from 8\,cm to 2\,cm by inserting two iron
plates which then also serve as top and bottom of the vacuum chamber.
Similar changes were made to turn DS4 into the correctionmagnet, CM. 
As a result fields up to 1.4\,T can now be generated in ET.

\section{The endpoit tagger, ET}

Figure \ref{map14} shows a field map of ET as measured with a current of
300\,A (???). \\

\label{map14}
\end{figure}
This field map was then taken to raytrace electrons of several energies
through the magnet. Figure \ref{trajet} gives a result for electrons
up to 170 MeV, which shows that ET can easily accommodate the 
required needs.\\

indicates the area of the field map.}

From the raytracing the point to point focus of the radiator is obtained,
which is also shown in fig. \ref{trajet}.
